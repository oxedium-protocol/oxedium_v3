BISMILLAH AL-RAHMAN AL-RAHIM
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

PREAMBLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This license governs the use, reproduction, modification, and distribution of
the software and associated documentation files (the "Software") released under
it. It is offered freely to humanity as a contribution to beneficial knowledge,
in the tradition of Islamic civilization's long service to science, mathematics,
engineering, and the common good.

The authors of this Software are Muslims who believe that all human action
carries moral weight before Allah, the Creator and Sustainer of all things. We
further believe that providing a tool which is then used to cause harm to human
beings is a matter we are accountable for, even if the harm is caused by another
hand. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever calls to guidance
will have a reward equal to the rewards of those who follow him" (Sahih Muslim,
2674). We extend the same principle in reverse: we do not wish to be callers,
even indirect ones, to harm.

This is not a license that attempts to codify the entirety of Islamic law
(Shariah) — a task that would be impossible in a legal instrument of this kind,
and that would require the ongoing interpretive work of qualified scholars across
countless situations. Rather, this license identifies a specific and narrow set
of use cases that are prohibited by near-universal consensus among scholars of
the four Sunni legal schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi'i, and Hanbali), as well as
mainstream Shia jurisprudence, and which are also recognizable as serious ethical
violations across many non-Islamic ethical traditions.

We release this Software in a spirit of openness and benefit to all people. The
restrictions below are not expressions of hostility toward any person or group.
They are an expression of our accountability before Allah and our commitment to
the principle found in the Quran, Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:2):

    "And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate
     in sin and aggression."

We invite all users of this Software — Muslim and non-Muslim alike — to consider
the ethical weight of what they build with the tools available to them.

PART I: GRANT OF RIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, including the Ethical Use
Restrictions set forth in Part II, the copyright holder hereby grants to any
person obtaining a copy of this Software a worldwide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive, irrevocable license to:

  1. Use the Software for any purpose not prohibited by Part II of this License;

  2. Copy, reproduce, and distribute copies of the Software, in source or
     compiled form, to any recipient;

  3. Modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works based upon the
     Software;

  4. Distribute modified versions and derivative works of the Software under
     the terms of this License or a compatible license that imposes no fewer
     restrictions than those in Part II;

  5. Sublicense the rights granted herein, provided that any sublicense is
     also subject to the Ethical Use Restrictions in Part II;

  6. Use the Software for commercial purposes, provided that such commercial
     use does not fall within the prohibited categories defined in Part II.

The above rights may be exercised in all media, formats, and distribution
channels, whether now known or hereafter devised.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART II: ETHICAL USE RESTRICTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rights granted in Part I are conditioned upon the following restrictions.
No person, organization, or legal entity may use, distribute, modify, or
incorporate the Software, in whole or in part, in direct or substantial support
of any of the following categories of activity. Each category is defined with
specificity to avoid ambiguity.

RESTRICTION 1 — USURY AND EXPLOITATIVE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS (RIBA)

The Software may not be used in the development, operation, maintenance, or
support of any financial system, platform, application, or service whose
primary function is the charging or collection of interest (riba) on loans
or credit extended to natural persons (individual human beings) who are in
conditions of financial need or limited financial alternatives.

    Clarifications:

    (a) This restriction targets predatory lending products, payday loan
        platforms, loan-shark operations, and high-interest consumer credit
        systems whose structural design extracts wealth from vulnerable
        individuals through the mechanism of compounding interest debt.

    (b) This restriction does not prohibit all use of the Software by
        financial institutions. The Software may be used in banking
        infrastructure, payment processing, accounting systems, financial
        data analysis, and other financial technology applications not
        primarily characterized by the extraction of interest from
        vulnerable natural persons.

    (c) This restriction does not require the copyright holder to audit
        every financial use of the Software. It establishes the ethical
        boundary; the user bears the moral and legal responsibility for
        compliance.

    Islamic basis: The prohibition of riba is among the most emphatic in the
    Quran. Allah says in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:275): "Allah has permitted trade
    and forbidden riba." And in (2:279): "If you do not [desist], then be
    informed of a war from Allah and His Messenger." The scholarly consensus
    across all major schools is that riba is among the gravest of prohibitions.

RESTRICTION 2 — PORNOGRAPHY AND SEXUALLY EXPLICIT CONTENT

The Software may not be used in the development, operation, maintenance,
hosting, distribution, or monetization of any platform, application, or
service whose primary purpose is the production, storage, distribution, or
sale of sexually explicit content, including but not limited to:

    (a) Pornographic video, image, or audio content involving real human
        beings;

    (b) AI-generated or algorithmically produced sexually explicit content
        depicting real or realistic human subjects;

    (c) Platforms whose primary commercial model is subscription to or
        sale of sexually explicit content.

    Clarifications:

    (a) This restriction does not prohibit use of the Software in general
        content platforms, social media, or media hosting services that may
        incidentally encounter or moderate such content, provided the
        platform's primary purpose is not the production or distribution of
        sexually explicit material.

    (b) Medical, clinical, or educational software dealing with human anatomy
        or sexual health in a non-exploitative, professionally appropriate
        manner is not prohibited by this restriction.

    Islamic basis: The preservation of chastity (hifz al-'ird) is one of the
    five essential objectives of Islamic law (al-maqasid al-khamsah). The
    Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Every eye commits zina (unlawful sexual
    act), and the zina of the eye is the lustful look" (Sahih Bukhari, 6243).
    The facilitation of pornography is therefore a facilitation of widespread
    moral corruption (fasad).

RESTRICTION 3 — GAMBLING AND GAMES OF CHANCE

The Software may not be used in the development, operation, or maintenance of
any platform, application, or service whose primary function is gambling,
wagering, or games of chance in which real monetary value or equivalent
fungible assets are staked against an uncertain outcome, including but not
limited to:

    (a) Online casinos, sports betting platforms, and poker applications;

    (b) Cryptocurrency gambling platforms;

    (c) Loot box systems and in-application purchase mechanics whose primary
        design is the randomized distribution of items of significant monetary
        value, where the randomization mechanism constitutes the core commercial
        model;

    (d) Lottery and scratch-card applications.

    Clarifications:

    (a) Games of skill where monetary entry fees are incidental and the outcome
        is determined primarily by player ability rather than chance are not
        prohibited by this restriction.

    (b) Statistical simulation, actuarial software, and probability modeling
        tools used in research, insurance, or risk assessment are not prohibited
        by this restriction.

    Islamic basis: Allah says in Surah Al-Ma'idah (5:90): "O you who have
    believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone altars [to
    other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of
    Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful." The prohibition of gambling
    (maysir) is explicit and unambiguous in the Quran.

RESTRICTION 4 — INTOXICANTS AND NARCOTICS

The Software may not be used in the development, operation, or support of any
platform, application, or service whose primary function is the production,
sale, distribution, or promotion of:

    (a) Alcoholic beverages;

    (b) Controlled narcotics and illegal drugs intended for recreational use;

    (c) Any substance whose primary purpose is the intoxication or
        incapacitation of the human mind.

    Clarifications:

    (a) Pharmaceutical software, clinical trial management systems, harm
        reduction platforms, addiction treatment services, and medical
        research applications are not prohibited by this restriction, even
        where such software handles data relating to controlled substances.

    (b) Regulatory compliance software used by government agencies monitoring
        controlled substances is not prohibited.

    Islamic basis: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Every intoxicant is
    khamr, and every khamr is forbidden" (Sahih Muslim, 2003). The scholarly
    consensus across all four Sunni schools holds that the facilitation of the
    production and sale of intoxicants is itself impermissible.

RESTRICTION 5 — SURVEILLANCE, PERSECUTION, AND OPPRESSION OF PERSONS

The Software may not be used as a material component in any system whose
primary purpose is the covert surveillance, tracking, identification, or
targeting of individuals or populations for the purpose of persecution,
discrimination, or denial of fundamental rights on the basis of religion,
ethnicity, political belief, or protected characteristic, including but
not limited to:

    (a) Surveillance infrastructure used by authoritarian states to monitor
        and suppress religious minorities, dissidents, or ethnic populations;

    (b) Facial recognition or biometric systems deployed specifically for the
        purpose of identifying and persecuting members of a religious or
        ethnic group;

    (c) Data collection and profiling systems designed to enable the
        targeting of individuals for detention, interrogation, or punishment
        based on religious observance or belief;

    (d) Tools designed to enable stalking, harassment, or intimate partner
        surveillance of private individuals without their knowledge or consent.

    Clarifications:

    (a) Legitimate law enforcement software operating under judicial oversight
        and the rule of law is not prohibited by this restriction.

    (b) Network security monitoring, threat detection, and cybersecurity
        tools are not prohibited by this restriction.

    (c) Parental control software with transparent and consensual application
        is not prohibited by this restriction.

    Islamic basis: Allah says in Surah Al-Hujurat (49:12): "O you who have
    believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin.
    And do not spy or backbite each other." The Prophet, peace be upon him,
    said: "The Muslim is the brother of the Muslim. He does not oppress him, nor
    does he abandon him" (Sahih Muslim, 2564). Participating in the apparatus
    of oppression against any people is a violation of foundational Islamic
    principles of justice.

RESTRICTION 6 — WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION

The Software may not be used in the development, design, guidance, deployment,
or targeting systems of weapons whose design purpose is the indiscriminate mass
killing of civilian populations, including but not limited to:

    (a) Nuclear weapons delivery and targeting systems;

    (b) Chemical weapons production, formulation, or deployment systems;

    (c) Biological weapons development, enhancement, or weaponization systems;

    (d) Radiological dispersal device design or deployment systems.

    Clarifications:

    (a) Defensive cybersecurity systems and purely defensive military
        infrastructure not designed for mass civilian casualties are not
        prohibited by this restriction.

    (b) Academic research, simulation, and threat modeling conducted in
        the context of arms control, disarmament, or public health is not
        prohibited by this restriction.

    Islamic basis: The Prophet, peace be upon him, commanded even in the
    context of legitimate warfare: "Do not kill women, children, the elderly,
    or monks in their monasteries" (reported by Abu Dawud, 2614). The
    scholars of Islamic military ethics are unanimous that indiscriminate
    killing of non-combatant civilians is haram without qualification. Weapons
    designed for indiscriminate mass civilian killing are structurally
    incompatible with Islamic rules of warfare.

RESTRICTION 7 — SYSTEMATIC DECEPTION AND FRAUD

The Software may not be used as a primary instrument of systematic deception
designed to cause material harm to individuals, including but not limited to:

    (a) Phishing systems, scam infrastructure, and social engineering
        platforms designed to deceive individuals into surrendering
        financial assets, personal credentials, or sensitive information;

    (b) Disinformation platforms whose primary function is the automated
        mass production and distribution of fabricated content designed to
        deceive the public on matters of material consequence;

    (c) Fraud systems targeting vulnerable populations, including the
        elderly or those in financial distress, through deceptive
        impersonation or false promises.

    Clarifications:

    (a) Creative fiction, satire, games, simulations, and entertainment
        platforms are not prohibited by this restriction.

    (b) Security research involving simulated phishing or social engineering
        conducted with institutional oversight and informed consent is not
        prohibited by this restriction.

    Islamic basis: The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "Whoever deceives
    us is not of us" (Sahih Muslim, 101). He also said, peace be upon him:
    "Truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to Paradise"
    (Sahih Bukhari, 6094). Systematic deception for material gain is
    categorically condemned across all schools of Islamic law.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART V: ISLAMIC ETHICS STATEMENT
(Companion Document — Accessible Explanation of the Restrictions Above)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section is not a legal instrument. It is an explanation, written plainly,
of why this license exists and what Islamic principles underlie its
restrictions. It is addressed to every person who encounters this Software —
Muslim and non-Muslim alike.

WHY THIS LICENSE EXISTS

We are Muslims. We believe that human beings are trustees (khulafa) on this
earth, as Allah says in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:30), and that this trusteeship
carries responsibility. Every act a person performs — including writing and
distributing software — is an act that will be weighed. We did not want to
release our work into the world with no consideration of how it might be used
to harm the people Allah created.

We are not under any illusion that a license can enforce morality. It cannot.
People who intend to do harm will not be stopped by a text file. But we
believe in the Islamic principle of bara'a, the disavowal of wrongdoing. By
stating clearly what this Software must not be used for, we have discharged
our duty to speak clearly. What a person does after hearing the truth is
between them and Allah.

THE FIVE OBJECTIVES OF ISLAMIC LAW (AL-MAQASID AL-KHAMSAH)

Classical Islamic scholars identified five essential things that Islamic law
exists to protect. These are:

  1. The preservation of religion (hifz al-din)
  2. The preservation of life (hifz al-nafs)
  3. The preservation of intellect and reason (hifz al-'aql)
  4. The preservation of lineage and family (hifz al-nasl)
  5. The preservation of wealth and property (hifz al-mal)

Every restriction in Part II of this license maps to one or more of these
objectives. Riba destroys wealth and exploits the vulnerable. Pornography
corrupts lineage and chastity. Gambling corrupts wealth and reason.
Intoxicants destroy the intellect. Surveillance and oppression destroy life
and religious freedom. Weapons of mass destruction destroy life entirely.
Fraud destroys wealth and trust.

We are not innovating new ethics. We are applying a 1,400-year-old ethical
framework, refined by generations of scholars, to a new domain.

ON THE PROHIBITIONS SPECIFICALLY

Riba (Usury): Allah declared war, in the Quran itself, on those who persist
in riba after being warned (Al-Baqarah 2:279). This is language used for
almost nothing else in the Quran. The scholars are unanimous in its
prohibition. We have narrowed our restriction to predatory lending targeting
vulnerable individuals because we sought to be honest and specific rather
than broad and unenforceable. We acknowledge that a fuller Islamic vision of
finance would go further; this restriction represents the minimum that
conscience demands.

Pornography: The Prophet, peace be upon him, described the eye, the heart,
and the hand as all capable of their own form of zina (Sahih Bukhari, 6243).
A platform dedicated to the mass industrial production of sexually explicit
content is, in our view, one of the most significant engines of moral
corruption in contemporary society. We will not knowingly contribute to it.

Gambling: The Quran explicitly names maysir (gambling) alongside intoxicants
as "defilement from the work of Satan" (Al-Ma'idah 5:90). This is not an
obscure ruling. It is among the clearest prohibitions in the primary sources.

Intoxicants: The hadith is definitive: "Every intoxicant is khamr, and every
khamr is forbidden" (Sahih Muslim, 2003). The category is broad and the
ruling is absolute. We have been careful to exclude medical and harm-reduction
software, because the preservation of life takes precedence over categorical
application of this restriction.

Surveillance and Oppression: The Quran commands justice ('adl) and forbids
oppression (zulm) in terms that leave no room for qualification. Allah says:
"And Allah does not like the oppressors" (Ali 'Imran 3:140). The Muslim
communities most harmed by mass surveillance technology in the contemporary
world are Muslim minorities under authoritarian regimes. We have a particular
duty not to contribute to systems that hunt our brothers and sisters for the
crime of practicing their faith.

Weapons of Mass Destruction: Islamic rules of warfare (fiqh al-jihad) are
explicit that non-combatants must not be targeted. The Prophet, peace be upon
him, prohibited the killing of women, children, the elderly, and monks
(Abu Dawud, 2614). A weapon designed to kill indiscriminately cannot be
made compliant with these rules. There is no scholarly position in mainstream
Islamic jurisprudence that permits the deliberate mass killing of civilian
populations.

Fraud and Deception: The Prophet, peace be upon him, walked away from a
seller who had concealed defective goods and said: "Whoever deceives us is
not of us" (Sahih Muslim, 101). Systematic, industrialized deception for
material gain is simply incompatible with the Islamic character (akhlaq) that
every Muslim is obligated to embody.

AN INVITATION

We do not release this Software with hostility toward anyone. We release it
with the hope that it will be genuinely useful, that its restrictions will
cause those who encounter them to reflect — even briefly — on what they are
building and why, and that the explanation above might, for some reader,
be an opening toward understanding the ethical coherence of Islamic values.

The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said: "None of you truly believes
until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself" (Sahih Bukhari,
13). We want, for every human being, what we want for ourselves: a life of
dignity, honesty, and safety from exploitation. This license is a small
expression of that wish.

    "Our Lord, accept this from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing."
    — Surah Al-Baqarah (2:127)
