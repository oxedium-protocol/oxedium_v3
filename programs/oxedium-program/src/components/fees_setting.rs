/// between the input and output vaults.
///
/// Fee logic:
/// - If the swap does NOT worsen the relative imbalance
///   (delta_in_bps <= delta_out_bps),
///   the base fee is applied.
/// - If the swap increases pressure on the output vault,
///   the fee grows non-linearly (quadratic curve) with liquidity deviation.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `vault_in`  - The source vault for the swap
/// * `vault_out` - The destination vault for the swap
///
/// # Returns
/// * `u64` - The calculated total fee in basis points (bps)
